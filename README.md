This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) using a variety of machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on the classic Iris dataset.
Objectives
- To build a predictive model for iris species classification.
- To understand the importance of different features in predicting iris species.
- To evaluate the performance of different machine learning models.
